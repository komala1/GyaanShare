# This script is used to interact with your Django project from the command line. You can use it to run your server, make database migrations, create apps, and more.
# The script sets up the environment for Django administrative tasks by configuring the settings module.
# It attempts to import and use Djangoâ€™s command-line execution function.
# If there are issues with the Django installation, it provides a helpful error message.
# When run directly, it invokes the main function to process command-line arguments and run the appropriate Django commands.
